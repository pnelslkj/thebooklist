Ending notes - there is no new coding
to be done and so the reading data part
project is complete, however since you
created a new app called posts. create
the posts_urls.py as learnt in djangobasics
point 17th and also make sure that 
project_urls.py is same as djangobasics 
11th point. 
Just restart the server and at the 
homepage you should see the
 list from the database.
