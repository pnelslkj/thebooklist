Static and Templates
-----------------------
the concept behind both of these
is to seperate the development work done for
backend and frontend. while the rest of the
files in django project are only worked upon
by backend developer. The files inside the
static and template folders are first designed
and developed by the frontend developer. 
frontend developer delivers these files to
backend developer and the backend developer
adds some django code inside some of these 
files to incorporate them in django project.

The templates includes only html files
the static files includes css, js and images
