Once  a new virtual env is created and you have entered it. it still doesnt have django so...

make sure you are entered in virtual env ( otherwise django will be intalled globally in your system )

pip install django

( you dont need to be inside project folder at this time because django is not getting installed in project
folder but the virtual env.)
